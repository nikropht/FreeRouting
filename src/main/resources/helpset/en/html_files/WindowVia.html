		<h3>The Via Rules</h3>
		<p>A via rule consists of a ordered set of  <a href="#Via">vias</a>,  which is used in the routing .  If  a layer is changed while routing and several vias would contain the previous and the next layer and would cause no clearance violations, vias earlier in the rule will be preferred to vias later on in the rule.</p>
		<h4><a name="Via"></a>Vias</h4>
		<p>A via consists of a name, a via padstack, a clearance class and a switch, if attaching smd-pins of the same net is allowed  or not.</p>
		<h4>Via Padstacks</h4>
		<p>A via padstack consists of a begin layer and an end layer and of a circle shape on each layer between the begin and the end layer.</p>
		<p>The following  is a description of the window with the via rules.</p>
		<h4>Available Via Padstacks</h4>Here you see the three buttons <i>Info, Create</i> and <i>Remove</i>.
		<p>After pushing the <i>Info</i> button a list with all available via padstacks will be displayed.</p>
		<p>With  the<i> Create</i> Button you can create a new via padstack. You you will be asked to provide the name of the new via padstack, the start and the end layer, and the default radius of the circle shape. In the following input window you can adjust this radius on each single layer, if you want  the shapes of the new via padstack to be layer dependent </p>
		<p>With the <i>Remove</i> button  you can  delete an existing via padstack in the database.  The deletion will be refused, if the padstack is still used in a via definition or somewhere else.</p>
		<h4>Available Vias</h4>Description of the buttons:		<blockquote>
			<p><i>Info</i></p>
			<blockquote>

			<p><a name="EditVia"></a><i>Edit</i> </p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>If you push this button, a window with a table for editing the vias will appear. Here you can adjust the <i>name</i>, the <i>padstack,</i> the<i> clearance class</i> and the <i>attach smd</i> property of the via according to your needs. Below this window are two buttons for adding new vias or removing existing vias.</p>
			</blockquote>
